## Blocks

### Overview

 Gutenberg Blocks in the `blocks/` folder are loaded with the autoloader. That is, you can simply create a folder of a new block with the necessary files and this blocks will be automatically available.

Use `StarterBlock` as an example to create new blocks.

 <!-- Each shortcode has its view files, its assets directory, which contains its own, individual css, js, images, fonts, etc. (these attachments need to be connected via wp_enqueue_style and wp_enqueue_script in the shortcode.php file, they are not automatically connected). This is necessary to ensure that shortcode shortcuts are loaded only when the shortcode is active and that you can transfer the shortcodes by simply copying the shortcode folder. -->
